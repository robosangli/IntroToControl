# IntroToControl
This repository is for the 'Introduction to Robotic Control' for Ananda Sangli & Lucas Magnell in the Fall of 2021 under the guidance of UIUC Assistant Professor Joao Ramos. An Arduino was set up to explore the relationship between a motor and an encoder, measure the motor's position, drive the motor with PWM (Pulse Width Modultation signals), and finally implement a PID (Proportional-Integrative-Derivative) Controller for the motor's position.
This project was inspired by the professor's 'HOPPY' project that simulate the hopping-kangaroo motion.
